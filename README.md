### Protection In Numbers

Has someone you love, inadvertently and foolishly entered their personal data into a scammer's form? Hopefully not, but someone else's   loved one has; with this tool you can help protect those people. The goal of this script is to blast fake information to a scam site that uses forms to get personal identifiable information. Hide the real people who made a mistake, purposefully with fake             information.
